Things that I still need to work on for MVP:
[x] user is able to delete a time entry from the time-entries list
[-] user hears a 'ding' sound each time a session/break completes
[-] user sees an alert whenever she starts the timer without submitting a taskname and categorylabel, or provide a default value in the backend whenever a user starts the timer without submitting a taskname and category label
[-] user is able to enable long break after a certain number of sessions which entails the timer cycling through mini-cycles of sessions/short-breaks for a specified number of sessions then starts long break in order to complete a cycle, and finally resets itself before the user press start again

Stretch goals:
[-] group time-entries by day, and display list of time entries by weekly pagination
[-] ability to filter time-entries by task and group time-entries by category inside each task
[-] ability to provide summary data such as productive hours by week, by day, hours spent on each task and/or category
