Things that I still need to work on:
- user is able to delete a time entry from the time-entries list
- user hears a 'ding' sound each time a session/break completes
- user sees an alert whenever she starts the timer without submitting a taskname and categorylabel, or provide a default value in the backend whenever a user starts the timer without submitting a taskname and category label.
- group time-entries by day, and display list of time entries by weekly pagination
